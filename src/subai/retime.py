"""Re-time an existing subtitle against the audio's own word timings.

Input: the cues of a human subtitle whose TEXT is right but whose TIMES are off, and the timed words
of an audio-only transcript of the same video. Output: the same cues, same text, new times.

Ported from /opt/projects/subtitle-ai (subtitle_ai/retime.py, decision 2026-10-03-subtitle-retiming);
the constants below were measured there on Love Is In The Air S01E01-E04 and S02E01.

* The subtitle is never ASR input and never repairs the transcript; it is only compared with it.
  Cue text is never changed.
* The correction is not a constant. It is estimated from the audio for this one file as a
  piecewise-linear function of time (a shift, a frame-rate stretch, or steps where a cut or an ad
  break differs). With too little evidence nothing is written (RetimeRefused).

Pure logic: no GPU, no files, no models.
